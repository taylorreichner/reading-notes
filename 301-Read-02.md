# Applying Atomic Design
- "organisms" are large sections of the page we can easily extract from the page 'basically the outlines'
- we then break those sections down into "molecules" 'items inside the "organisms"
- Then we break those sections down into "atoms" 'the casic elements of each "molecule"
# Applying Atmoic Design part 2
- define a folder structure with "organisms" to keep things organized
- components can be resuable as long as you make the small and idependent 
- basically break everything down to it can be resuable for different variants of the same data
# Thinking in React
- Break each component into its own using a specific Hierarchy 'top to bottom i think'
# UI Components by Design
- Foundation component- The base of your website, creates the overarching look and feel to the website
- Application component- a specific application being built into your website
- learn, design, isolate, elaborate, build, intergrate. those are the steps of adding new things to your software
- Make you library organized so future devs can read and add easily
# What are JavaScript Callbacks
- Callback- a function that is called after another function is done
# JavaScript Callback Functions
- Link is giving 404 error
# First-class Function
- You can pass a function as an arguement to another function
# MDN Callback Function
- callbacks are often used to excecute code after another function is ran
# JavaScript Classes
- classes can be defined in other expressions
- can create a function in itself
# An intro to Object-oriented programming
- use class to name certain specific objects
- to extend a class use extend after you have named this class
- class is only a function when call by a new operator
# Intro
- we create objects to define specific data
- this cannot be interchanged
- you can call a function without an object but you will get a undefined error.. so basically you cant i guess
