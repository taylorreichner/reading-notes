# TDD Where Did It All Go Wrong
- Tests can help you see how your api works
- write tests against the stable contract of the api
- refactoring helps you seperate things you do and dont need to test
- Some people thinks TDD just slows you down
# Red, Green, Refactor
- this method helps devs compartmentalize their process
- red - visualize and create your functions. when you test they may fail but that is good because you can take those failures and find the solution to your initial code.
- green - this is where you make your tests pass with your code.
- refactor - once you are at the end of the green phase you should look to refactor your code to be clean and in a place that is easily accesable
- doing tdd with everything will end up being faster as you wont run into as many unforseen issues
# cycles of TDD 
- keep your tdd simple, you dont want to write extra code, take on failure at a time
- you can get stuck by making your tests to specific to the code. you will have to back track and generalize the test effectivly wasting time
