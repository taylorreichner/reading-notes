# SQL bolt
- relational data base is a collection of 2 demensional tables sort of the an excel spread sheet 
- you can use JOIN to combine row data across seperate tables
- you can use left right and full join to make sure no data gets left out
- you can use NULL values but it will take up extra space, its better to usue zeros or empty strings
# Database Normalization
- we want to minimize duplicate data and simplify data as much ass possible
- each table should be as specific ass possible
