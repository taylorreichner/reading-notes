# MDN
- You can use template literals to inject pre determined code into a string
- This allows you to change strings according the how the function is used
# Google Dev
- template strings can be defined with domain specific languages
- use a \ for multi line strings
# CSS tricks
- you can set constant literal as a let or a const
- again you can use a template literal as data set and use . to call the sepcific data
# MDN forEach
- forEach executes a function once for each item in an array
- you can minpulate the array wif shift, this will delete a portion up the point the shift has been called
# for vs forEach
- forEach only works in Arrays
- a for loop with continuasly loop through data
- for is good for counting, but become much more complex
