# Clean code
- Bad or quickly written code creates issue for the future
- to write clean code it will take discipline, through a "paistakingly aquired sense of cleanliness
# TDD by example
- failure is progress, this will help us find our solution with extra clues.
- you can bend your code to make the test pass and work backwards to get it running with the correct code
- start simply
# quantity always trumps quality
- Always keep coding, even if your not coding the most amazing app or something difficult, keep coding to improve your skills
# Cunninghams law
- this may apply to coding because when you ask a "wrong" question the teacher, peer, or TA knows exactly what your thinking and is able to help you mentally switch gears and put you on the right track.
